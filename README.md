ParticleSystem_mouse_interaction_Processing
===========================================

This code is based on Daniel Shiffman's Nature of Code book however have a slight deviation in the mouse interaction for more fun

The change which I have made is in the void addParticle() function, here is the line of code, 

void addParticle(){
particles.add(new Particle(newPVector(mouseX, mouseY)));
}

Have fun!
